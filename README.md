# Stash

I use the internet for many things: travel plans, work, things left to read later. Our brains switch context, Safari can’t. Stash was borne of this frustration. 

Click one button and the window’s tabs are saved for later; no longer using memory, no longer cluttering your screen. Come back when you’re ready and you can restore your stash to a new window. If you want more control, use the stash overview to prune or open tabs as you see fit.

Stash makes Safari fit the way I browse the internet. I hope it helps you too.

*Stash came from leaving Chrome and missing OneTab. If you want something like Stash for Chrome or Firefox, [give it a go](https://www.one-tab.com).*
